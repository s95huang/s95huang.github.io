# üëã About Me

I'm currently a PhD candidate at the University of Waterloo. My current research mainly focuses on the application of large language models in autonomous driving and energy domains. Aside from that, I am actively working on integrating learning-based algorithms into vehicle and energy systems (prediction, control etc.).

I have 4 years of work experience in ADAS systems and autonomous driving software development across passenger vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, and mining vehicles.

Please email me at s95huang@uwaterloo.ca if you are interested in my research, including collaborations, or if you have any questions.
