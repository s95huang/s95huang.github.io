# 👋 About Me
Hi everyone! My name is Shucheng Huang or Bruce. 
I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/'>UWaterloo</a>, supervised by <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/mechatronic-vehicle-systems-lab/'>Amir Khajepour </a>  and <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/computer-science/about/people/fhs'>Freda Shi</a>. 

I have 4 years of work experience in ADAS systems and autonomous driving software development across passenger vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, and mining vehicles.


##  Research Areas
**Main Research:**
- **Large Language Models in Autonomous Driving**:  Decision-making, Safety, and Interaction

- **Autonomous Driving**: Perception, planning, and control, time-series prediction, V2V/V2X

**Others:**

- **Energy Systems**: Energy storage, optimization, and management




Please email me at s95huang@uwaterloo.ca if you are interested in my research, including collaborations, or if you have any questions.
