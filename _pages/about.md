# üëã About Me
Greetings! 
I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/'>UWaterloo</a>, supervised by <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/mechatronic-vehicle-systems-lab/'>Amir Khajepour </a>  and <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/computer-science/about/people/fhs'>Freda Shi</a>. 
 My research interests include large language models in autonomous driving, time-series prediction. If you are interested in my research, would like to collaborate, or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via email at s95huang@uwaterloo.ca.
 
 My current research highlights the following perspectives:
- **Large Language Models in Autonomous Driving** 
  - More human-like, interpretable Decision-making
  - Safe Driving in dynamic environments considering social norms and interaction

- **Learning-based Algorithms in Autonomous Driving**
  - Trajectory/motion prediction
  - End-to-end learning for planning

- **Energy Systems (including vehicle)**
  - Time Series Forecasting
  - Offline Optimization and online management




Prior to Phd studies, I completed my M.A.Sc. in Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering at UWaterloo and worked at Almon equipment Ltd. and LoopX Innovation Inc.

I have 4 years of work experience in ADAS systems and autonomous driving software development across passenger vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, and mining vehicles.
I participated in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/watonobus/">WATonoBus project</a> at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mechatronic-vehicle-systems-lab/">MVS Lab</a> working on software and algorithmic development of decision-making module required for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/university-waterloo-launches-canadas-first-driverless">Canada's first autonomous shuttle bus</a> approved via the ministry's autonomous vehicle pilot. 
<!-- Check out my [research projects](/research/) and [publications](/publications/). -->



<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
